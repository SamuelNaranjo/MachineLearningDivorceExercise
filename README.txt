This is my project. It's a logistic regression algorithm applied to a very common problem in todays society: DIVORCE
Sometimes it's hard for us to make a decision whether to stay in a relationship or let it go.
I designed this problem using a database from the uci machine learning database repository and this database consist in 54 questions using a scale of 0 to 4.
In the end people said if they had gotten divorced or not and so we can now based on their answers if it is possible to save the relationship
